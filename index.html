        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <img src="assets/Images/me.png" height="220px" alt="David Blais" />

        <p>I am a Minnesota native that graduated from Metropolitan State University with a BA in film studies with a complete focus on Screenwriting. I moved to Atlanta, GA for the film work and after not making any headway, I moved my focus towards computer programming at a Georgia Tech University Bootcamp to make a career change.</p>

        <p>I am a huge fan of media; I enjoy films, video games, and books that tell very creative and fulfilling stories that are well thought out and well executed. From living in Minnesota, I do enjoy snowboarding, but there isn't much opportunity for me to use that skill in Georgia.</p>
    
        <p>All in all, I'm pretty easy to get along with and I always enjoy making new friends!</p>
